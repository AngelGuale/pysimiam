Using the GUI
-------------

Start the simulator with the ``python qtsimiam.py`` command. It is important that this command is executed inside the downloaded folder (but not inside any of its subdirectories).

Here is a screenshot of the Qt graphical user interface (GUI) of the simulator:

The GUI can be controlled by the menu or the toolbar buttons (or their equivalent keyboard shortcuts). The first button is the `Open` button ``Ctrl-O`` and lets you open a world with the robots. The second button is the `Rewind` button and resets the simulation. The third button is the `Play` button, which can be used to play and pause the simulation. The speed of the simulation can be controlled with the slider to the right. The set of `Zoom` buttons allows you to zoom in and out to get a better view of the simulation.
